*** Number Guess Project ***  
This is the fifth and final project of the freeCodeCamp relational database course toward obtaining a relational database certification. 
In this project I utilize the bash terminal to create a git repository titled number_guess and shell script titled number_guess.sh. Further I create a database titled number_guess with tables users and games. The bash commands are recorded in the bashterminal.sh script for continuity. 

In the number_guess.sh I create a function titled "GUESSING_GAME" that will record a new user or pull prexisting stats on a returning user. It will then create a secret number and accept gueses until the correct guess is make and the table will be updated incrementally. 

The final database from testing this project is the number_guess.sql file.
