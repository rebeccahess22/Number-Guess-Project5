***Number Guess Project***  

This is the fifth and final project of the freeCodeCamp relational database course toward obtaining a relational database certification. 
In this project, I utilize the bash terminal to create a git repository titled number_guess and a shell script titled number_guess.sh. Further, I create a database titled number_guess with tables users and games. The bash commands are recorded in the bashterminal.sh script for continuity. 

In the number_guess.sh script, I create a function titled "GUESSING_GAME" that will record a new user or pull preexisting stats on a returning user. It will then create a secret number and accept guesses until the correct guess is made, and the table will be updated incrementally. 

The final database from testing this project is the number_guess.sql file.
